# Contributing

You can contribute by filling issues when something goes wrong or was not what
you expected. I will do my best to fix the issue either in the code or in the
documentation, where applicable. A spend not more that a few evening per month
on the gitlab cookbook just to keep it up-to-date (always lagging a release behind)
with the latest GitLab version.

You can also send pull requests for any feature or improvement you think should be
included in this plug-in. I will review each of them before merging.

If you feel like you would like to do more development, feel free to drop me a line,
I will add you as a contributor to the repository.
